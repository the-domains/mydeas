# Innovation time - week of May 24 2016

Influence this week ...

Tragically Hip will do a last tour, with Gord Downie on his death bed. 

Thinking about how project 24 has in a sense become what we didn't want, an exclusive and elusive club for innovators.

Spending time discussing innovation with my wife, VP of Strategic Pricing at walmart.
